# Tic-Tack-Toe-Game
A classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple two-player game allows users to play X and O turns alternately and checks for a winner or a draw after each move. The game includes a reset feature and a new game to play again and uses JavaScript to handle all the logic dynamically.
